# React State Checkpoint

This project is part of the React Bootcamp checkpoint. It demonstrates the use of React class components, state management, conditional rendering, and lifecycle methods.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Class-based React component
- ✅ Local state with:
  - `person` object (full name, bio, image, profession)
  - `shows` boolean to toggle profile visibility
  - `interval` counter showing seconds since mount
- ✅ Button to show/hide the profile dynamically
- ✅ Lifecycle methods to track time:
  - `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`

## 📷 Preview

The app displays a button that toggles a user profile, and shows a live timer counting how many seconds have passed since the app was loaded.
